      Welcome to Palmer Dabbelt's (<a href="http://www.google.com/recaptcha/mailhide/d?k=01Q9RIh1Z47iw5r-F-Fg5Zzw==&amp;c=O9oaDxrrMJEPgtqZnbf5CN7SBfKLqRF3NLTqHQy8jc8=" onclick="window.open('http://www.google.com/recaptcha/mailhide/d?k\07501Q9RIh1Z47iw5r-F-Fg5Zzw\75\75\46c\75O9oaDxrrMJEPgtqZnbf5CN7SBfKLqRF3NLTqHQy8jc8\075', '', 'toolbar=0,scrollbars=0,location=0,statusbar=0,menubar=0,resizable=0,width=500,height=300'); return false;" title="Reveal this e-mail address">email</a>) Homepage.<br/>
      <br/>
      My <a href="resume.pdf">resume</a> (<a href="resume.pdf.gpg">signed</a>) is availiable online, though it's probably not particularly up to date as I'm not looking for a job right now.<br/>
      <br/>
      Some of my schoolwork is availiable <a href="school/">here</a>.  It's just a small subset for now, as I'm working on making all my old work build cleanly.  If there's anything missing that you're interested in, just send me a mail and I'll try and make sure it's included.<br/>
      <br/>
      As I've recently switched to Apache httpd, my photo album is broken.  If you want to see the photo album, just send me an email and I'll update it.
