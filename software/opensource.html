    <title>Palmer Dabbelt's Contributions to Open Source Projects</title>
  </head>

  <body>
      This page should list all the contributions I've made to open source
      projects.  There's so many different bug trackers that I'd like a
      centralized place to keep track of them to ensure that they all end up
      getting resolved.  As such, unresolved bugs will be listed first and
      then moved later.<br/>
      <br/>

      Lulu heavily used Okular's "Save Selection as Image" functionality for
      her homework assignments.  We'd recently switch the machines to XFCE and
      I didn't want to pull in a whole bunch of KDE4 junk so I started looking
      for an alternate PDF reader with the same functionality.  MuPDF seemed to
      be easily hackable, so I decided to just add the functionality.<br/>
      <br/>
      I submitted a patch that implemented the requested functionality, but it
      seems the developer is not particularly enthuiastic about taking the
      patch.  It's proving pretty easy to mantain out-of-tree, so I'm just
      going to stick with it. <br/>

      Fixes a simple compile warning due to not having C99 mode.  So far
      upstream has been unresponsive.<br/>

      <b>Evolution: Workaround Improper GB-2312 Mail Encodings</b><br>
      <a href="https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=666896">

      Lulu discovered that Evolution didn't set the correct character encoding
      all the time for some Chinese encodings.  The problem actually stems from
      the fact that there are 2 Chinese character encodings, one which is a
      superset of the other.  Some clients would specify the subset as the
      encoding while including characters only valid in the superset.
      Evolution would correctly print out garbage in this case, but as many
      other mail clients seem to have a workaround for this specific case it
      seemed reasonable for Evolution to have the workaround as well.<br/>
      <br/>
      I submitted a patch that changed the encoding to the superset whenever
      the subset was detected.  This was fairly simple because Evolution
      already had an encoding mapping list, so I just changed it.<br/>

      Gentoo prefix used to have a forked OpenJPEG package that started lagging
      behind the official Gentoo tree.  I noticed the old build and commented
      that the fork has probably been obseleted due to a move to cmake.
      Prefix decided to use the un-fork the package.<br/>

      Upstream started depending on a newer version of a specific library so I
      updated the dependency list in Gentoo's package<br/>
      <br/>      

      <b>Gentoo: Missing >=dev-libs/glib-2.31.0 in prefix tree</b><br/>

      This was pretty straight-forward, there were just a few patches that
      needed to be updated.<br/>

      This was a pretty uninteresting missing dependency from a Gentoo
      package.<br/>
